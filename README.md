# dantion-ml-bangkit-capstone
This project is about traffic accident and street crime audio-based detection.
We created this project to complete our study in Bangkit 2022 led by Google, GoTo, and Traveloka.

## Executive Summary
Indonesia is one of the countries that has a fairly high level of transportation use. Given the high degree of transportation use, it is predictable that there have been a number of
incidents, including street violence. This has occurred due to the economic difficulties that some Indonesians face. Furthermore, transportation accidents, both single and inter-transportation incidents, occur often. This is frequently caused by people's failure to use public transportation. Some cases have been handled slowly by connected parties on the streets and resulting in fatalities.

Therefore, we have an innovation on the matter. We intend to provide victims of street crime with a more responsive service. The service takes the form of a DANTION device that is able to capture the sound of the victim's vehicle horn based on the pattern weâ€™ve established. For the case of a road accident, DANTION will catch the collision sound, which will subsequently display a notification on the DANTION application. With DANTION, we hope that cases that occur on the streets, especially crimes and road accidents, will be addressed more quickly by the relevant parties.
